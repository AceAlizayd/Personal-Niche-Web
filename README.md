<h2> Some Information: </h2>
I'm currently coding this project while simultaniously learning CSS and JavaScript. 
<br>
The best way of learning is by doing and so this project is part of my education.
<br>
I've hard some issues thus far dealing with flexbox, but I've figured it out now - hopefully.
<br>
At first all the images would be scatterd, or mess with the text and I found it frustrating but I messed around with it until something fit, and for the parts I didn't know how to do (thus far) I used AI to explain and help me figure it out.
